# Bookstore Inventory System

A simple object-oriented Python system for managing a bookstore that supports paper books, e-books, and demo books. The system allows for inventory management, purchasing, delivery handling, and removal of outdated books.

## üìö Features

- **Inventory Management**  
  - Add books to inventory
  - Remove outdated books by publication year

- **Book Types (Using Inheritance and Abstraction)**  
  - `Paperbook`: Physical books with stock quantity  
  - `E_book`: Digital books (one at a time)  
  - `Demo_Book`: Free demo, not for sale or delivery  

- **Purchase Process**
  - Verify book availability
  - Reduce stock on successful purchase
  - Handle delivery to physical address or email

## üèóÔ∏è Structure

- `Book (ABC)`: Abstract base class for all book types
- `Paperbook`, `E_book`, `Demo_Book`: Derived classes implementing specific behaviors
- `Invent`: Inventory class managing books
- `BookStore`: Facilitates adding, purchasing, and removing books
- `Test`: Contains a static method to demonstrate system behavior

## üì¶ Example Output

Running the system will:
- Add 3 books
- Remove books older than a defined threshold (10 years)
- Attempt purchases for each type with delivery

## üîç How to Run
